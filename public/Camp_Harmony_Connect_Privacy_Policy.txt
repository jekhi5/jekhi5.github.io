Camp Harmony Connect – Privacy Policy
Effective date: August 10, 2025

Summary
Camp Harmony Connect helps campers and staff check in, receive announcements, and view camp information. We collect only what’s needed to provide these features, and we do not sell your data.

What we collect & why
• Account information (e.g., name, email, phone number) — to create and manage your account via Firebase Authentication.
• Authentication identifiers (Firebase UID) — to secure access and keep you signed in.
• Device push token (FCM/APNs token) — to send announcements and alerts you opt into.
• Check‑in status (checked‑in / checked‑out) — so staff can send relevant notifications and manage attendance.
• Operational logs (server logs and error information) — to run, secure, and troubleshoot the service.

How we use your data
• Provide and improve core features (sign‑in, notifications, check‑in).
• Secure the service and prevent abuse.
• Communicate important updates related to camp activities.

Sharing
We do not sell your data. We share information only with service providers who help operate the app:
• Google / Firebase — authentication and messaging (and, if enabled, diagnostics/analytics).
• Apple — push delivery on iOS devices (APNs).
• Hosting & databases — our Serverpod backend and infrastructure providers that store data securely on our behalf.
These providers process data under their own terms and security controls and only for the purposes described above.

Data retention
Account data is kept while your account is active. Check‑in records and logs are retained only as long as necessary for camp operations or legal requirements. You can request deletion at any time (see “Your choices”).

Your choices
• Notifications: You can turn off push notifications in the app or in your device settings.
• Access/Deletion: Email us at campharmonydev@gmail.com to request a copy or deletion of your data.

Children’s privacy
This app may be used in a camp context with minors. Accounts should be created or managed by camp staff and/or a parent/guardian where required by law. If you believe a child used the app without proper consent, contact us and we will remove the information.

Security
We use industry‑standard safeguards (encrypted transport, access controls). However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

International transfers
Your data may be processed in the United States or other regions where our providers operate and maintain infrastructure.

Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We’ll post updates here and adjust the effective date at the top. For material changes, we may also provide an in‑app notice or other appropriate communication.
