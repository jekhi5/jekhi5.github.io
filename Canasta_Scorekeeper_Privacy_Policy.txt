Privacy Policy for Canasta Scorekeeper Last updated: [Insert Date]

Overview Canasta Scorekeeper (“the App”) is designed to help users keep
track of scores while playing Canasta. The App functions as a simple,
on-device calculator and score manager. We respect your privacy and are
committed to being transparent about the minimal data we handle.

Information We Collect No Personal Data Collected The App does not
collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information
(PII).

We do not collect: - Names - Email addresses - Phone numbers - Payment
information - Location data - Usage analytics or tracking data

On-Device Data Only The App stores active and previous game scores
locally on your device only. This data: - Never leaves your device - Is
never transmitted to any server - Is only used to allow you to continue
games later

You may delete the App at any time to remove all locally stored data.

In-App Purchases The App offers one optional in-app purchase: a tip to
support the developer. All purchases are processed securely by Apple’s
in-app purchase system. The App does not have access to your payment
information. Apple may collect certain transaction-related data
according to Apple’s Privacy Policy.

Children’s Privacy Because the App collects no personal information, it
is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect data from
children.

Third-Party Services The App uses no third-party SDKs, analytics tools,
advertising networks, or tracking technologies.

Data Security Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no
risk of external data exposure. Any game data is stored only on your
device, where its security depends on your device’s operating system
protections.

Changes to This Privacy Policy If we make changes to this Privacy
Policy, we will update the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of
the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated
policy.
